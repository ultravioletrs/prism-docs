# Billing

To perform operations on the platform, a billing account has to be set up and a payment plan subscribed to. Available plans can be found on the [pricing page](https://docs.prism.ultraviolet.rs/#pricing).

## Setting up a billing account

To set up a billing account, follow these steps:

1. After registration to the platform and creating a workspace, navigate to the billing section on the sidebar.

#### CVM Billing

Invoices for CVMs will be automatically generated and sent once each month. You can view these invoices in the "Invoices" tab of the billing section. Each invoice will detail the usage of CVMs and any associated costs.

Estimates of accrued costs for CVMs can be viewed in the CVMs page on the details of each CVM. This will give you an idea of the expected costs before the invoice is generated.

Pending payments on any CVMs will prevent you from logging in to the platform. Ensure that all invoices are paid to maintain access.

A list of unpaid invoices will be displayed on the workspaces page prior to logging in. Use the link on the invoice to pay it directly, and access the platform once the payment is confirmed.
