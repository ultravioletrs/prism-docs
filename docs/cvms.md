# Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs)

## Overview

Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide a secure environment for running computations while ensuring data confidentiality. CVMs are available in multiple configurations, allowing users to select a flavor that best suits their needs. The currently supported flavors include:

- **GCP**: Confidential Virtual Machines hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
- **Azure**: Confidential Virtual Machines deployed on Microsoft Azure.
- **Manager**: Confidential Virtual Machines running on our dedicated cloud infrastructure.

Before computations can be executed, a CVM must be created and properly configured. Once set up, it can be selected for running workloads securely.

## **Confidential Computing Virtual Machines (CVM) Configurations**

- **GCP CVMs** run on the **N2D machine series**, powered by **AMD EPYC Milan processors** with **up to 224 vCPUs and 896 GB RAM**. These instances leverage **SEV-SNP** for memory encryption, ensuring data remains confidential even from the hypervisor. They support **persistent and local SSD storage**, but **GPUs and nested virtualization are not available**. GCP CVMs offer **Secure Boot, vTPM, and integrity monitoring**, enhancing firmware security and trusted execution. They run **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** and can be provisioned using **cloud-init** for automated configuration. The VMs require **on-host maintenance termination**, ensuring workloads remain secure during infrastructure updates.

- **Azure CVMs** utilize the **DCasv5 series**, featuring **AMD EPYC 7763v (Milan) processors** with **up to 96 vCPUs and 384 GB RAM**. These machines incorporate **SEV-SNP** for full memory encryption and hardware-isolated execution. They support **Premium SSD storage** but lack local disks, making them ideal for workloads requiring strict security without temporary storage dependencies. Azure CVMs also include **vTPM and Secure Boot**, enhancing firmware integrity and trusted execution. The VMs run **Canonical's Ubuntu Confidential VM (20.04 LTS)** and can be provisioned using **cloud-init** for automated configuration.

- **Manager** spawns QEMU-based **secure virtual machines (SVMs)** configured for confidential computing and built using **Buildroot**. It runs on a **Q35 machine type with an AMD EPYC CPU**, supporting **8 vCPUs (scalable up to 64)** and **16 GB RAM (maximum 30 GB)**. The VM uses **AMD SEV-SNP for full memory encryption** and is booted with **Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) for UEFI**. It runs **focal-server-cloudimg-amd64** and leverages a **RAM-only architecture** based on **Linux kernel v6.12** with an **initramfs root file system**, ensuring that secrets stored in memory are destroyed upon shutdown.

  - **Manager integrates a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) with AMD SEV-SNP** to create **fully encrypted VMs** that can be verified using **remote attestation**. SEV-SNP protects the entire VM, while HAL eliminates the need for a full OS by providing a **lightweight execution environment** that abstracts hardware complexities.

  - **During boot, Manager ensures system integrity using remote attestation**. The **AMD Secure Processor (AMD SP) measures the VM’s contents and includes the hash in the attestation report**. Since **SEV alone only measures the OVMF firmware**, Manager extends attestation by embedding **hashes of vmlinuz and initramfs inside OVMF**. At boot, **OVMF verifies these hashes before loading the kernel and file system into memory**, ensuring that only the expected and trusted software stack executes.

  - **Manager includes a virtual TPM (vTPM) within the CVM, measured and attested by AMD SEV-SNP**. After boot, the vTPM functions as a standard TPM, measuring the boot process, including the kernel and initial file system, to ensure system integrity.

  - More information on manager can be found on [manager docs](https://docs.cocos.ultraviolet.rs/manager).

## Creating a CVM

To create a CVM, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the CVMs Section:**

   - From the dashboard, click on the **CVMs** tab to access the CVM management page.

2. **Initiate CVM Creation:**

   - Click the **Create CVM** button to begin the setup process.

   ![Create Button](img/cvms/create_button.png)

3. **Select Configuration Options:**

   - From the dropdown menu, choose the desired CVM flavor (GCP, Azure, or Manager).
   - Specify the amount of RAM (required for Azure and GCP CVMs).
   - Define the vCPU count (configurable for Azure and GCP CVMs only).

4. **CVM Provisioning:**

   - After submitting the configuration, the CVM creation process will begin. This may take a few minutes.
   - Once created, the CVM will appear in the list with its unique **ID, URL, and status**.

## Viewing CVM Details & Managing Certificates

Each CVM is initialized with default certificates that are used to verify secure communication between the CVM agent and Prism. To view or manage a CVM’s certificates:

1. **Access the CVM Details Page:**

   - Navigate to the CVM list.
   - Click on the **CVM ID** to open its details page.

2. **Manage Certificates:**

   - **Download Certificates:** Retrieve the default certificates for verification and secure connections.
   - **Revoke Certificates:** Invalidate compromised or outdated certificates.
   - **Renew Certificates:** Extend the validity of existing certificates.
   - **Issue New Certificates:** Generate additional certificates as needed.

   > **Note:** Default certificates are automatically loaded into the CVM during creation. Any newly issued certificates must be manually transferred to the CVM for use.

## Removing a CVM

If a CVM is no longer needed, it can be removed using the following steps:

1. **Navigate to the CVM List:**

   - Open the CVMs page.

2. **Initiate Removal:**

   - Click the **Delete** button next to the CVM you want to remove.

3. **CVM Deactivation:**
   - The CVM’s status will change to **Inactive** upon removal.

## Additional Notes

- CVMs provide an extra layer of security by ensuring that computations occur in a protected execution environment.
- Once a CVM is removed, its resources are deallocated, and it cannot be recovered.
- For Azure and GCP CVMs, compute resources should be selected carefully based on workload requirements to optimize cost and performance.
- Regularly update certificates to maintain secure connections.

By following these guidelines, users can efficiently manage their Confidential Virtual Machines while maintaining a high level of security and performance.
