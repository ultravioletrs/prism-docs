# Getting Started with Prism

Welcome to Prism! This guide will walk you through setting up your first workspace, creating secure compute environments, and running your first computation.

## What is Prism?

Prism is a confidential computing platform that enables secure multi-party computations using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). It allows multiple parties to collaborate on computations without exposing their sensitive data or algorithms.

## Quick Start Overview

1. **Account Setup** - Create your account and log in
2. **Workspace Creation** - Set up your collaborative environment  
3. **CVM Setup** - Create Confidential Virtual Machines for secure computing
4. **Computation Management** - Define, configure, and run secure computations

## Account Setup

### Creating Your Account

1. Navigate to the Prism UI at [https://prism.ultraviolet.rs](https://prism.ultraviolet.rs)
2. Click **Register** to create a new account
3. Provide your username, email, and secure password
4. Complete registration and verify your email if required

![Registration Process](../static/img/ui/login.png)

### Logging In

1. Go to the login page
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click **Login**

![Login Page](../static/img/ui/login_page.png)

After successful login, you'll be directed to the workspaces page where you can select or create workspaces.

## Workspace Management

### Understanding Workspaces

Workspaces are collaborative environments where teams can:

- Share secure computations
- Manage user permissions and roles
- Control access to algorithms and datasets
- Monitor computation runs and results

### Creating a New Workspace

1. From the workspaces page, click **Create New Workspace**
2. Provide a descriptive workspace name
3. Configure initial settings and permissions
4. Click **Create Workspace**

![Workspace Creation](../static/img/ui/projcreate.png)
![Workspace Setup](../static/img/ui/newproj.png)

### Joining an Existing Workspace

If you've been invited to a workspace:

1. Check your email for workspace invitation or login to prism
2. Follow the invitation link
3. Accept the invitation
4. The workspace will appear in your workspace list

### Accessing Your Workspace

1. Select the desired workspace from your list
2. Click **Enter Workspace** to access the dashboard
3. You'll now have access to all workspace features

## CVM (Confidential Virtual Machine) Setup

### What are CVMs?

CVMs are secure, isolated computing environments that run inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). They ensure your computations remain confidential even from the cloud provider.

### Creating Your First CVM

> **Prerequisites**: You must have an active subscription with available backend providers (Azure, GCP, Ultraviolet, External).

1. Navigate to **CVMs** section in your workspace
2. Click **Create New CVM**
3. Select your preferred backend provider
4. Configure CVM specifications:
   - Memory allocation
   - CPU requirements
   - TEE type (AMD SEV_SNP/Intel TDX)
5. Click **Create CVM**

![Create CVM](../static/img/ui/new_cvm.png)

### CVM Status Monitoring

After creation, your CVM will go through several states:

- **Creating**: Initial setup in progress
- **Starting**: CVM is booting up
- **Online**: Ready for computations
- **Offline**: Not available for use

![CVM Creating](../static/img/ui/cvm_creating.png)
![CVM Online](../static/img/cvms/online-cvm.png)

> **‚è±Ô∏è Setup Time**: CVMs typically come online within 2-5 minutes after creation or longer ~10 minutes for public cloud CVMs Azure/GCP.

## Computation Management

### Understanding Computations

A computation in Prism CoCoS involves multiple parties collaborating securely:

| Component | Role | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Algorithm** | Algorithm Provider | ‚úÖ Required | The secure code to be executed |
| **Dataset** | Dataset Provider | ‚ö™ Optional | Training or input data (if needed) |
| **Result Consumer** | Result Consumer | ‚úÖ Required | Party authorized to retrieve results |

### Creating a Computation

1. Navigate to **Computations** in your workspace
2. Click **New Computation**
3. Fill in computation details:
   - **Name**: Descriptive computation name
   - **Description**: Purpose and expected outcomes
   - **Agent Configuration**: In enclave agent TLS configurations

![New Computation](../static/img/ui/new_computation.png)

### Setting Up User Roles

#### Step 1: Navigate to Roles

1. Go to your computation's details page
2. Click on **Roles** tab

![Roles Tab](../static/img/ui/roles.png)

#### Step 2: Assign User Roles

1. Select the role you want to populate (Algorithm Provider, Dataset Provider, or Result Consumer)
2. Click **Add Members**
3. Search for workspace users
4. Select users and confirm assignment

![Role Assignment](../static/img/ui/view_role.png)
![Add User to Role](../static/img/ui/add_user_to_role.png)

> **üìù Note**: Users must already be invited to the workspace before they can be assigned computation roles. A user cannot belong to more than one role, to add permissions you should actions on the required [role](./roles.md).

### Managing Computation Assets

#### Creating Assets

Users assigned to roles must create their respective assets:

1. Navigate to **Assets** section
2. Click **Create New Asset**
3. Choose asset type (Algorithm, Dataset, etc.)
4. Upload an optional sample of the asset

![New Asset](../static/img/ui/new_asset.png)
![User Assets](../static/img/ui/user_assets.png)

#### Linking Assets to Computations

1. From your assets page, find the relevant asset
2. Click **Link to Computation**
3. Search and select the target computation
4. Confirm the association

![Associate Asset](../static/img/ui/associate_user_asset.png)

### Running Computations

#### Prerequisites Check

Before running, ensure:

- ‚úÖ All required roles are assigned
- ‚úÖ All necessary assets are linked
- ‚úÖ At least one CVM is online
- ‚úÖ Users have uploaded their public keys

The **Run Computation** button will be disabled until all requirements are met.

![Run Disabled](../static/img/ui/run_computation_disabled.png)

#### Executing the Computation

1. Click **Run Computation** (when enabled)
2. Select an available online CVM
3. Confirm execution

![Run Computation](../static/img/ui/run_computation.png)
![Select CVM](../static/img/ui/select_cvm.png)

### Monitoring Execution

#### Real-time Monitoring

Once started, you can monitor:

- **Events**: High-level computation milestones
- **Logs**: Detailed execution information from the inenclave agent

![Events and Logs](../static/img/ui/logsEvents.png)

#### Stopping a Running Computation

You can stop a computation at any time by:

1. Clicking the **Stop** button on the events card, or
2. Using the **Stop** button in the Logs tab

## Security & Public Keys

### Why Public Keys Matter

Public keys are essential for:

- User identification and authentication
- Secure asset uploads
- Encrypted result retrieval
- Maintaining computation integrity

### Managing Your Keys

1. Generate a public/private key pair using your preferred tool or using [Cocos CLI](https://docs.cocos.ultraviolet.rs/cli#command-keys)
2. Upload your public key to your Prism profile
3. Keep your private key secure - you'll need it for:
   - [Uploading algorithms and datasets](https://docs.cocos.ultraviolet.rs/cli#command-algo)
   - [Retrieving computation results](https://docs.cocos.ultraviolet.rs/cli#command-data)

> **üîê Security Best Practice**: Never share your private key. Prism only needs your public key for verification.
