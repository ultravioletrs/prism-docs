# Overview

Prism is a web based SAAS that is intended for use by the end user, to allow for a user in an workspace to benefit from the entire CoCoS AI system. Prism adds a layer of security and user management to the CoCoS AI system by providing functionality such as:

- User and Consortium (workspace) creation and management
- Policy creation and management (between users, workspaces, and computations)
- Billing and payment management
- Computation creation and management

## What is Prism AI

Prism AI is a platform designed for secure, confidential AI workloads using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). It enables secure VM provisioning, fine-grained access control, and end-to-end encryption to ensure data privacy in collaborative AI workspaces. The platform supports various computational backends and includes logging, monitoring, and a user-friendly interface. Itâ€™s particularly useful in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government for secure data processing and collaboration.
