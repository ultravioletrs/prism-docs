# Invitations

## Overview

Workspace administrators can invite new members to collaborate within their workspace. Invited users receive notifications and can choose to accept or decline invitations.

> **Note:** Prism invitations work only for users who are already registered on Prism. Users must create an account before they can receive and accept workspace invitations.

## Steps to Invite a User

1. Open the **Invitations** section from the sidebar
