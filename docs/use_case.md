# Use cases

This document presents a **real-world scenario** where Prism is used to perform a **secure multiparty computation (MPC)** for collaborative training of a COVID-19 prediction model. The use case demonstrates how **confidential data from multiple institutions** can be aggregated and processed without compromising data privacy.

While this example is grounded in pandemic response, the underlying approach generalizes to any sensitive, collaborative AI training effort ‚Äî including applications in **healthcare, finance, and government**.

## üåê High-Level Use Case Context

Modern machine learning often requires diverse and high-quality datasets, but privacy, legal, and competitive concerns restrict data sharing. Prism addresses this by enabling **cross-organization AI training using secure enclaves** (Confidential Virtual Machines or CVMs), allowing data to remain private even during processing.

This COVID-19 use case highlights:

- **Collaborative AI training** without exposing raw datasets.
- **Compliance with data protection regulations** (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
- **Deployment of algorithms in secure compute environments**, fully auditable and cryptographically verified.

It builds on the COVID-19 training algorithm provided in the [AI repository](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/ai/tree/main/covid19) and executes it securely through Prism and the Cocos framework.

## Summary Workflow

1. **Provisioning**: Define a computation and onboard stakeholders.
2. **Asset Registration**: Upload datasets and algorithms securely.
3. **CVM Creation**: Set up confidential compute infrastructure.
4. **Execution**: Trigger and monitor the multiparty computation.
5. **Result Consumption**: Authorize and download final outputs.

## 1. Provisioning the Prism Environment

### Create the Workspace and Computation

- Set up a **workspace** as a secure collaboration boundary.
- Define a **computation** to encapsulate the training task.
- Ensure a valid **billing account** is attached for tracking usage.

üìò Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started.md) for setup instructions.

### Invite Participating Organizations

All participating institutions must:

- Be registered on Prism.
- Accept invitations to the workspace.
- Be assigned appropriate roles (e.g., **Asset Provider**, **Result Consumer**).

Each role enforces strict access control policies.

## 2. Registering Assets

### Uploading Datasets

Datasets must follow [AI repo guidelines](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/ai/tree/main/covid19#testing-with-cocos). Each dataset should:

- Be zipped and verified via checksum.
- Be uploaded using the CLI and linked to the computation.

Example:

```bash
./build/cocos-cli data ../ai/covid19/datasets/h1.zip ./private.pem
```

Repeat for all datasets.

### Uploading the Algorithm

Python-based training scripts should be uploaded with their dependencies:

```bash
./build/cocos-cli algo ../ai/covid19/train.py ./private.pem \
  -a python \
  -r ../ai/covid19/requirements.txt
```

![Upload Algorithm](img/usecase/upload_algo.png)

The algorithm must conform to the Cocos runtime interface (as detailed in the AI repo).

## 3. Confidential Compute via CVM

CVMs are secure environments where the algorithm executes under **hardware-based encryption** (Intel TDX, AMD SEV, etc.).

Steps:

1. Go to the **CVMs** page and click **New CVM**.
2. Complete the required configuration.

![Create CVM](img/usecase/create_cvm.png)

üìò Detailed setup instructions: [CVM Docs](/docs/cvms.md)

After creation, export the CVM's gRPC endpoint:

```bash
export AGENT_GRPC_URL=192.0.2.1:6110
```

This allows CLI interaction with the agent.

---

## 4. Execution of the Secure Computation

Once all assets are in place:

1. Return to the **Computations** dashboard.
2. Click **Run** and select the target CVM.
3. Monitor the computation state in real time.

The computation will transition through:

- **Waiting for Algorithm**
- **Waiting for Datasets**
- **Running**
- **Completed**

![Running Computation](img/usecase/running_computation.png)

All events and logs are cryptographically signed and verifiable.

---

## 5. Result Retrieval and Post-Processing

Authorized users can retrieve results via:

```bash
./build/cocos-cli result ./private.pem
```

![Completed Computation](img/usecase/completed_computation.png)

Note: Results are **one-time consumable** and linked to access control lists defined by the computation owner.
