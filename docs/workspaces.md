# Workspaces

Workspaces represent a consortium of users, computations, and resources that provides a single way to allow management of resources in the system. The workspaces / workspaces simplify access control by allowing only users who are in a particular workspace to access resources which they have been assigned to.

Within workspaces, different users have different roles that allow them to only perform certain operations within the workspace, such as creation of other users and other admin related tasks. A single user can belong to multiple workspaces, with which they can have different roles based on the policy assigned.

For any user to access the CoCoS system, they must be part of an workspace, and have to be signed in to the workspace.
